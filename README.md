# GRE Tunnel Network Security Implementation

## Project Overview
Strategic implementation of network security architecture utilizing GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) tunnel with OSPF integration. Demonstrates enterprise-level protocol configuration and security framework deployment in a controlled environment.

## Technical Architecture
- **Protocol Stack:** GRE Tunneling, OSPF Routing
- **Hardware:** Cisco 2911 Routers
- **Network Segments:** Multi-subnet implementation
- **Security Framework:** Tunnel encryption capability
- **Verification Tools:** IOS diagnostic commands

## Core Implementation
| Component | Specifications |
|-----------|----------------|
| GRE Tunnel | Point-to-point encapsulation |
| OSPF | Area 0 implementation |
| Routing | Dynamic protocol integration |
| Security | Base configuration with enhancement pathways |
